# MathJax on GitHub Pages

This is an example of using MathJax to render LaTeX on a GitHub Pages site.

Here’s an inline equation: $E = mc^2$

And here’s a display equation:
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx
$$

You can include as many equations as you need. MathJax will render these expressions when the page loads.

```python
def function():
  print ("some info")
```
